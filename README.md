# Quasar lighcurve modelling

In this project, we intend to perform tools for agnostic lensed quasar light curves modelling. 
The process involves being able to model:

* intrinsic light curves, 

* microlensing,

* disk reverberation,

* time delays, 

* measurement uncertainty,

* sampling

and to account for all of them jointly. Due to the extra difficulty introduced by the joint modelling of all these effects, 
we will start by modelling these effects independantly before moving to a bigger picture of quasar modelling.
